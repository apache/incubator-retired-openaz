/**
 * A simple mechanism for displaying messages to the user.
 * 
 * At the moment this is a very thin layer on top of the Vaadin Notification class.
 * There are two reasons for this class existing:
 * 	- simplifying (slightly) the code, in that the type is in the method call just like logging
 * 	- this is a central point where all messages are done, which allows us to globally change how they are displayed if we wish.
